# Advanced Epidemiological Modeling Research Project
Author: Amos Mwaura

Comprehensive SIR/SEIR epidemiological models with demographics and mortality for research applications.

## Research Capabilities

### Model Types
- Classical SIR: Basic outbreak dynamics
- SIR + Demographics: Endemic disease persistence  
- SIR + Mortality: High-fatality pathogen analysis
- SEIR + Demographics: Exposed compartment modeling

### Validated Research Findings
- Boarding School: R0=3.96, 95.7% attack rate
- Endemic Equilibrium: Persistent 10% infection rate
- High Mortality: 26.6% population-level deaths

## Usage
Load framework and run analysis:
